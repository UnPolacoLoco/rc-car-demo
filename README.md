# RC Goliath Breadboard demo

A demonstration using LEDs on a breadboard for my Arduino RC Goliath mod.
This repo contains code that can be used to exemplify movement and other features of my Arduino RC Goliath on a breadboard with a couple LEDs. 
Built and tested on ARDUINO 1.8.4 IDE..

1. Download and install the Arduino Nunchuk library from Gabriel Bianconi's github: https://github.com/GabrielBianconi/arduino-nunchuk
2. Download the .ino file from this master repo
3. Run the .ino and when prompted by the Arduino IDE to create a folder, do so.
4. Set up the breadboard according to the instructions on my blog, here: https://polacolocoblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/05/homefront-the-revolution-rc-goliath-arduino-mod-breadboard-demo/

# Libraries used
